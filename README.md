# Life-Long-Machine-Learning

This repository is a collection of Jupyter notebooks focused on key concepts and methods in lifelong machine learning. All content will be organized as interactive notebooks with explanations, code, and visualizations to help understand the implementation through research papers or studies on the topic.

## Contents
ðŸ“˜ Current topics (in progress):

âœ… Continual Learning â€” Available now

ðŸ“˜ Planned additions:

ðŸ”œ Transfer Learning

ðŸ”œ Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)

ðŸ”œ Progressive Neural Networks (PNN)

ðŸ”œ Replay buffers in sequential training

ðŸ”œ Adaptive Learning

## Structure

Each concept is presented inside its own self-contained notebook, combining intuitive explanations with runnable code. No external documents â€” everything you need will be within the notebook itself.
